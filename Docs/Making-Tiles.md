## Introduction
You can totally make your own tiles. Tactic tiles are represented as python classes.
You can, if you want, write the files in the editor of your choice and then upload them to
your tactic resource library. But most often you will use one of the online editors that are part
of the tactic system. These online editors have special supports for writing tiles. The specifications for writing 
a tactic tile class are explained [here](Tile-Structure). 

The first of the online editors is the [Module Viewer](Module-Viewer). It presents a tile, in its
raw form, as a python class. If you're an accomplished python programmer, and comfortable with
python classes, then you might want to use this editor. In addition, even if you aren't comfortable 
with python classes, you might have to use the Module Viewer to fix a tile that has been garbled
by the second editor, which I will describe in the next paragraph.

The second online editor is the [Tile Creator](Tile-Creator). It's designed to provide much more
scaffolding for the construction of tiles. Be careful. If you do anything fancy in a tile created in the 
module viewer, there's a chance it will be lost if you resave the tile from the Tile Creator.
