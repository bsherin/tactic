As explained in [the introduction to making tiles](Making-Tiles), this is the tile editor that
provides minimal scaffolds. It's mainly just a text editor for your tile code. 
The interface is pretty much self-explanatory. But when writing your tiles 
you'll want to refer heavily to the relevant sections of this wiki. This mainly means the
section on [Tile Structure](Tile-Structure) and the section on [Tile Commands](Tile-Commands)

For convenience, you can get a quick view of the API by clicking the "Show API" button. 
This will give you a little browsable view at the right of the module viewer.

If you're the kind of person who likes to keep your hands on the keyboard, 
you can consult the list of [keyboard shortcuts](Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts).
One particularly useful keyboard shortcut is ctrl-space, which brings up the autocomplete
widget.
