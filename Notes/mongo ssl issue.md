# pip install mongo ssl issues openssl
It seems like I have to downgrade, start mongo, then re-upgrade

To get mongo to work I seem to have to downgrade openssl sometimes

brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies openssl
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/30fd2b68feb458656c2da2b91e577960b11c42f4/Formula/openssl.rb

This site: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59006602/dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-opt-openssl-lib-libssl-1-0-0-dylib

suggests this: `brew switch openssl 1.0.2t`


But other cases seem to require me to re-upgrade
brew reinstall openssl
