Getting Started
===============

Creating an account
------------------------------

First, you need an account. Right now the only way to get an account is to email
me, Bruce Sherin, at bsherin@northwestern.edu. In response, you'll get a username
and password.

Then head over to https://tactic.northwestern.edu and use your credentials to log in.
After you do, you can click on your account name at the top right of your browser window
to edit your profile and change your password.

First steps with collections
----------------------------

After you log in, you'll be taken automatically to the resource
management page. To get started using tactic, you need to load in some
data. Your libary should already have some collections loaded. To view
one of these collections, select it in the list and click the blue
:guilabel:`view` button. (You can also double_click directly on the item.) A new
web browser tab should open and you should see a table (or freeform
document) with your data.

If you want, you can also explore additional sample collections
available in the repository, which provides resources that can be used
anyone.

Click “Show Repository”. This will allow you to see resources in the
repository.

Select one of the data collections from the list that appears. Click
“Copy to Library” and the collection will be added to your own personal
library.

Finally, click “Hide Repository” again to go back to your own library.

Alternatively, you can `upload one of your own
datasets <Uploading-Data.html>`__

Also, before you try to do anything, you should head over to the “code”
tab of your resource library and make sure there are some tokenizers there.
If there aren’t, import some of the tokenizers from the repository.

Working with your collection
----------------------------

If you haven’t already loaded a collection, do that. Then head over to
the `Main interface <Main-interface.html>`__ section of the documentation.
