Uploading Data
--------------

You can upload one of your own datasets. There are two modalities
available for datasets, “table” and “freeform.” Freeform datasets
consist of a set of unstructured text documents. Table datasets consist
of a set of tables of data.

To upload data, go to the collections tab of your user library. Click
“choose files” next to either the “import as_table” or “import as
freeform” buttons. Then select some files. **Note: You can select any
number of files and these files will be the “documents” in your new
“collection.”**

For table collectons, data must be in the form of xlsx, csv, tsv, or
plain text (txt) files. The first row of an xlsx, csv, or tsv file must
contain the headers for the columns. Data in a txt file is treated as a
series of rows of text with rows separated by newlines.) If multiple
files are selected, each of the files is treated as a separate document
within the collection. If an xlsx file with multiple sheets is selected,
each sheet is treated with as a separate document. It’s okay to mix and
match file types.

After choosing the files, click the corresponding import button. You’ll
be prompted for a name for your new collection. After you hit return,
the name of your new collection should appear in the list below.

Tactic will try to make its best guess as to the encoding of the file.
If it runs into any decoding problems, it will let you know.
