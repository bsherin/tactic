Welcome to the TacticText documentation, a place of wonder and
enjoyment. This is the *documentation* for Tactic. If you want to access tactic itself, then you

New to Tactic?
--------------

You might want to start with `Getting Started <Getting-Started.html>`__. This will tell you,
among other things, how to get a user account.

You will be using the `Library Interface <Library-Interface.html>`__ to manage your various resources such
as data collections and saved projects. This is where you can `upload your own data <Uploading-Data.html>`__.

Most of the work you'll do, analyzing data, is done in the brilliantly-named `Main interface <Main-interface.html>`__.
There is also a special version of the Main Interface that functions much like a Python Notebook. It's described
in `Logs and Notebooks <Log-And-Notebook.html>`__.

You'll quickly find that you want to make your own tiles. The `Tile Creator <Tile-Creator.html>`__ is
a scaffolded interface for building tiles. The `Module Viewer <Module-Viewer.html>`__ is the
tile-building tool for more advanced python programmers. Admission: I always use the Tile Creator.

When writing your own tiles, you'll need ot make use of the special commands that Tactic makes available
for you. These are documented in `Tile Commands <Tile-Commands.html>`__. To understand more of the nuts and bolts
of how tiles are constructed you can study the section of this documentation
on `Tile Structure <Tile-Structure.html>`__.

Tactic makes use of a large number of excellent `open-source resources <Docs/open-source-resources.html>`__.
