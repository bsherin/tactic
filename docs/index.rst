Using Tactic

-  `Getting Started <Getting-Started>`__
-  Using the resource library and repository [not written yet]

   -  But you can read about `uploading data <Uploading-Data>`__

-  Working with the `Main interface <Main-interface>`__
-  Using `Logs and Notebooks <Log-And-Notebook>`__
-  `Making <Making-Tiles>`__ your own tiles:

   -  The `Tile Creator <Tile-Creator>`__ is a scaffolded interface for
      building tiles.
   -  The `Module Viewer <Module-Viewer>`__ is the tile-building tool
      for more advanced python programmers.
   -  The same `Keyboard Shortcuts <Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts>`__
      work in both.
   -  The `Tile Version History <Tile-Version-History>`__ machinery
      built into Tactic might save you (if it actually works).

-  `Which tiles are available when <Which-tiles-are-available-when>`__
