The Module Viewer
=================

As explained in `the introduction to making tiles <Making-Tiles.html>`__,
this is the tile editor that provides minimal scaffolds. It’s essentially
just a text editor for your tile code. The interface is hopefully
self-explanatory. But when writing your tiles you’ll want to refer
heavily to the relevant sections of this manual, namely, the
section on `Tile Structure <Tile-Structure.html>`__ and the section on `Tile
Commands <Tile-Commands.html>`__

If you’re the kind of person who likes to keep your hands on the
keyboard, you can consult the list of `keyboard
shortcuts <Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts.html>`__. One particularly useful
keyboard shortcut is :kbd:`ctrl-space`, which brings up the autocomplete
widget.
