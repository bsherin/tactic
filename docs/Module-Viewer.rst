The Module Viewer
=================

As explained in `the introduction to making tiles <Making-Tiles.html>`__,
this is the tile editor that provides minimal scaffolds. It’s mainly
just a text editor for your tile code. The interface is pretty much
self-explanatory. But when writing your tiles you’ll want to refer
heavily to the relevant sections of this wiki. This mainly means the
section on `Tile Structure <Tile-Structure.html>`__ and the section on `Tile
Commands <Tile-Commands.html>`__

For convenience, you can get a quick view of the API by clicking the
“Show API” button. This will give you a little browsable view at the
right of the module viewer.

If you’re the kind of person who likes to keep your hands on the
keyboard, you can consult the list of `keyboard
shortcuts <Module-Viewer-Keyboard-Shortcuts.html>`__. One particularly useful
keyboard shortcut is ctrl-space, which brings up the autocomplete
widget.
