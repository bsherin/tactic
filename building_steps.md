`docker-compose build` or `docker-compose build tactic_main`

## build javascript bundles and css using webpack
from the `tactic` directory

note that scripts that can be run with `npm run`, as below are specified in package.json
The webpack configuration is in webpack.config.js

### Develop

`webpack —env.mode=development`,
`or
 `npm run build` 

### production

`webpack —env.mode=production`
or

## To push out a new version:
