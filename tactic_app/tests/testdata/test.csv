I spent the last money I had on gas today. Im broke until next Thursday :(,FALSE
My girlfriend decided it would be a good idea to get off at Perth bus station when she was coming to visit me and has since had to spend all her money on a taxi to get to me here in Dundee. Any chance some kind soul would get us some pizza since we don't have any cash anymore?,FALSE
It's cold  I'n hungry  and to be completely honest I'm broke. My mum said we're having leftovers for dinner. A random pizza arriving would be nice.  Edit: We had leftovers.,FALSE
hey guys:  I love this sub. I think it's great. (Except the sob stories. I miss when this place was fun!) Anywho  I've given a pizza out before so thought I would try my luck at getting one. My friend  who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much  decided to come down and visit me for the night! I would love to be able to be a good host and order her a pizza to go with some beer!  Again  no sob story. Just looking to share a pizza with an old friend :),FALSE
Feeling under the weather so I called out off work today! I hate requesting because I feel like I'm begging so I thought I'd give back!   (I'd offer pizza if today were payday :C),TRUE
We're in Tampa Florida...moving to Ybor on Friday. My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com  since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.   My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.   I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons  I can get 8 pizza rollers  1 large pizza  and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest  if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!   The pic for our huge TECO deposit :/ http://imgur.com/B0uoo,FALSE
(Request) I have given a few things on reddit  a copy of skyrim + 1 year of xbocks live  and soon to be a binder full of magic cards  when i can mail it. I would love  if possible  a kinder egg. I cant get them in the states  and I want the joy  and wonder  and hell  german chocolate. if you think I am lying  check my submissions and comments  please direct me to where i can get some of this chocolate goodness.... Texas - USA,FALSE
Wasnt really sure what to put as the title  uni student  recently moved interstate (Victoria australia to Queensland australia) am running a little low on funds till wednesday  was hoping maybe a kind stranger could order me a pizza and i can return the favour on wed?,FALSE
Austin  Texas  My two roommates and I are hungry as hell. We were all sort of counting on the deposit from our last apartment to help us out  but they claimed there was damages  so we did not receive anything. So  we're sort of struggling. Is anyone able to help us out for dinner tonight? We'd really appreciate it!  EDIT: Received a Dominos gift card from jetboyterp! THANK YOU!,TRUE
I've been unemployed but working odd jobs. I worked a job yesterday which I thought paid up front - it did not. Now I'm sitting at home dreaming of pizza (literally  I took a nap and dreamt there was pizza in my fridge  but woke up to nothing but leftover pasta). Will pay forward when I get a chance!,TRUE
Been a lurker for some time  figured I'd give it a shot. Nothing special about me. Just moved to San Francisco and don't know many people  so I figured I'd just stay in tonight and hope for some cheesy goodness. :),FALSE
I am a stay at home mom of two kids i live with my husband his parents and my kids! The only reason that I am unemployed is because my husband was hit by a drunk driver a little over a year ago and was seriously injured and was almost killed! so i quit work to help him through recovery and take care of the kids while living with my in-laws off of their ssi checks (which are tiny)! Its the end of the month and we're broke! We are not starving but we aren't eating all that well either! Please be my pizza hero!,FALSE
Hey recently moved downtown  but still working in sandy springs so I am spending all of my money on gas.  I don't get paid until wednesday and would love some pizza.  I will definitely pass on the love once I get my check!,FALSE
I have never requested a pizza before but I've given a few out  so I'm a firm believer that this works. However  I'm spending Christmas with the in-laws  who are sceptical about the generosity of Redditors. Please prove them wrong with a pizza! Will send a thank-you of the whole fam  including cat! We are in R.O.I,FALSE
You would make me a very happy person.,FALSE
It would be much appreciated  and payed forward later on. ,TRUE
We are a group of five local community college kids in Modesto CA  gathering to play some retro games (NES and SNES) and we are all dying for a change of ramen. Would anyone be kind enough to help us out? Some pie sounds fantastic (when doesn't it?)  Thanks for reading.  FSM bless.,FALSE
-I'm located in Virginia. It would be great to have some pizza tonight  feeling under the weather. I don't get paid until the weekend  and this would make our day. ,TRUE
Been looking for work for 2 weeks since moving back to my hometown.. Haven't had a paycheque for 2 months. Finally get a lead  two phone interviews  and an interview scheduled for today. I get in there  and the HR manager explains that they  Tried to reach me yesterday  to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them  so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.  Pizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really  really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. The friends I'm staying with give me a bite here and there  but they're very low income with 3 kids and I try to avoid it at all costs. Would seriously appreciate it  and pay it forward!,FALSE
I can't draw.. at all but I'd really love a pizza for me and my roommate tonight and I thought I'd try and cheer him up with some since he is pretty down today. I can try and draw you something in MS paint? I don't have kittens or cute cat pictures I can show so sorry to dissapoint :(,FALSE
We're a group of 4 college students  who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza  so we thought we may leave it to the RAOP gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. We live in Central California  and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza!  ,FALSE
I hope I'm doing this right. I waited before posting  because I thought I would have money for food tonight. I tried selling some textbooks on Craigslist  but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. The money I was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. I am completely out of food and very hungry. One pizza would be enough to get me through tonight  and hopefully I'll be able to get these books sold tomorrow.,FALSE
I have an O-Chem midterm in about 3.5 hours (2:15 Pacific) I have $1.80 in my account [http://i.imgur.com/qo6Oo.jpg&lt;====(proof here) ] and all this studying is making me hungry.  (will share with other lucky students in the Chem tutor room)  Edit: Located in Santa Barbara  CA. Here---&gt; http://g.co/maps/xvqg4  on campus. ,FALSE
Starving writer  here  located in Savannah  just recently moved;  *   Myself and husband  both working but no money  nothing in the fridge.  *  We have much love  still  it's hard to eat out your heart  or something like that.  *  If you pizza me  I will thank you in haiku  customized for you  *  And  when things improve  I will pay it forward  too:  Zen pizza haiku!  ,TRUE
Hiya~  This isn't my main account  but I have some friends from real-life who know my main  and I want to keep this private. I'm using an old throwaway  as I figured it might help to prove a little bit that I really *am* an active reditor. (Promise! :3) I used this throwaway to publish a story to /r/nosleep that got a fair amount of attention. (Check it out if you're interested.)  Anyway  I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder  and I've been feeling like absolute shit for the past week  and my family doesn't even get it. They just say that I'm screwing up and I feel like I can't take it anymore.   Some comfort food would be really nice  if some kind person might be willing to buy me a pizza  to go along with my movie. I'll even write you a story about something you choose  if you want.  Thanks!~  **EDIT**: Oh  and fyi  I've never received pizza on my main account either. O.O,FALSE
I got an inner ear infection three weeks ago  and the vertigo is bad enough that I can't work. I'm a college student and I'm quickly running out of Ramen  hoping I can get to work again before the rent is due. If someone wants to send me a pizza or come hang out (Bozeman  MT) that would be awesome!,FALSE
I get paid next Thursday I just a move out on my on own im using my neighbors wifi i could really use a pizza,FALSE
I have a CSGO match and will be practicing until our the match at 9:00.  BUT...today is my GF day to work late and when she gets home I already know she isn't going to be in the mood to cook. Our money is tied up with xmas gifts until next pay day  so just wondering if anybody can help us out so we can get our munch on?! ,FALSE
